# Overview of Brainfuck Tutorial Guide

Hello user, we have created a guide to introduce the bizzare language of Brainfuck and provide few guides and tutorials of sample programs.

The aim of this document is to provide the user with direction with the following tasks:
* Print a series of number
* Print Hello World
* Addition of integers


## How We Collaborated Together

At the beginning of this assignment, we were collaborating with each other during classtime. We have used the time in class to brainstorm few ideas and applications we could do guides for. Upon deciding the topic of brainfuck we have created a group chat in discord to distribute tasks and research areas to aid us in the language. 

We utilized git and created a folder to collaborate on.

## How We Created Our Guide

To create our guide, we used various sources of documentation and applications. We used an online compiler to code on a website to reduced the complixity.

### Using Markdown

We were introduced to markdown which is a simple and effective method of creating a guide.

Since our knowledge in markdown style guides were limited, we used various guides and tutorials to increase our understanding of the method.

### Learning Best Practices for Web Writing

Developers should get in the habit of using markdowns and web writing as a form of documantation. This will significantly increase efficient communication and reduce pototential erros.

In this guide, we have labeled each steps and used markdown forms to increase clarity. 


A ‚ùó indicates information that the user does not want to ignore. It will be generated if error occurs.

## Conclusion

The creation of this guide has challenged us as a developer. Learning a new language is hard, especially a language as bizzare as brainfuck. 

This assignment gave us the opportunity to approach a problem through the eyes of a developer who is learning a diffcult language. This has helped us to comb through our knowledge learned and ultimately made us into a better developer.

This assignment has made us realize the importance of a good communication within a team. Our group has always been working solo and this assignment challenged us with team cooperation.

Thank you for using our first guide. We hope you find enjoyment in this brief tutorial of the most useless language ever created.
